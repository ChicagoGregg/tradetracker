# Trade Tracker: A Psychological Tool for Disciplined Trading

**Trade Tracker** is a minimalist JavaScript-based tool designed to help traders maintain focus, discipline, and emotional control during trading sessions. By limiting users to five core trades and one optional "Bonus" trade, it enforces structured decision-making—a critical component of trading psychology.

## Why Trading Psychology Matters

Successful trading hinges on managing emotions like **fear**, **greed**, and **overconfidence**, which often lead to impulsive decisions. Key psychological challenges include:

- **Loss Aversion**: Holding losing positions too long to avoid regret.
- **Overtrading**: Chasing profits due to greed or FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).
- **Confirmation Bias**: Ignoring contrary market signals to justify decisions.
- **Emotional Rollercoasters**: Volatility-triggered panic or euphoria.

This tool addresses these challenges by fostering **discipline**, **consistency**, and **risk awareness**—cornerstones of a resilient trading mindset.

## How Trade Tracker Enhances Your Trading Psychology

### 1. **Limits Cognitive Overload**
   - Track **5 core trades** + 1 Bonus trade to avoid overtrading and impulsive decisions.
   - Reduces decision fatigue, allowing focus on high-quality setups.

### 2. **Encourages Strategic Patience**
   - The Bonus trade acts as a psychological "pressure valve," curbing greed while allowing controlled flexibility.

### 3. **Promotes Emotional Neutrality**
   - **Light/Dark Theme**: Reduces eye strain, creating a calmer workspace.
   - **Sound Alerts**: Notify without triggering panic (e.g., stop-loss triggers).

### 4. **Builds Accountability**
   - Visual tracking discourages revenge trading and reinforces adherence to predefined rules.

## Psychological Best Practices with Trade Tracker

- **Pre-Market Routine**: Set your 5-trade limit *before* the session to avoid emotional bias.
- **Review Daily**: Analyze trades to identify emotional patterns (e.g., premature exits due to fear).
- **Stick to the Bonus Rule**: Use the optional trade only for high-conviction opportunities, not FOMO.

By integrating structured tracking with psychological safeguards, **Trade Tracker** helps transform raw emotion into disciplined execution—a key differentiator between short-term gamblers and long-term traders.

**Pro Tip**: Pair this tool with a trading journal to correlate decisions with emotional states over time.
